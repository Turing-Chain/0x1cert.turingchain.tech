TuringCerts adopts Decentralized Identifier Standard (DID) proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n2. TuringCerts provides each certificate holder with an unique identifier via a hash value to prevent being tampered with.\n3. Its anti-counterfeiting feature is the cornerstone that leads to a sustainable certificate storage and tracking ecosystem."},"1":{"title":"(2) How to safeguard user privacy?","content":"TuringCerts adopts the “BlockCerts” developed by MIT Media Lab's early opensourced certificate infrastructure, which is inspired by the “EU GDPR's Least Privilege Principle” so as to grant the verification party with least yet most sufficient information. In addition, TuringCerts utilizes asymmetric encryption scheme such as RSA, which guarantees high privacy even during information transfer."},"2":{"title":"(3) How to sustain TuringCerts's footprint as the global leader?","content":"TuringCerts is afiliated with the Xccelerator from UC Berkeley Blockchain Lab, from whom will continuously on-board and integrate the latest technical breakthroughs in Silicon Valley.

Finally, TuringCerts is being supported by its geographical advantage and relevant user pool to conduct social experiments in Hong Kong and Taiwan campuses."},"3":{"title":"(4) Why certificates need blockchain?","content":"1. Certificates are usually used at a large scale, and there are many cross-domain information transfers. If everyone uses the same agreement, they can communicate seamlessly. This is generally difficult to achieve due to trust factors, and the advent of blockchain has provided the possibility of unifying these standards. \n2. No one can easily paralyze the database, and the possibility of losing or tampering with identity data is extremely low. This is an incorruptible system with no single point of failure. \n3. After integrating the blockchain, the time cost of certificate verification can be greatly reduced."},"4":{"title":"(5) If the blockchain technology (IOTA, IPFS) we adopt disappears, will the certificate issuer be affected?","content":"We will ensure that there are one or more fully backed up nodes that are sufficient for data transfer to the new main chain."},"5":{"title":"(6) Why utilizing IOTA instead of Ethereum?","content":"1. Fast, no commission, we have set up a full node to quickly issue certificates. \n2. The design of Ethereum itself is expected to become a world computer, but the certificate does not need these additional computing functions. It only needs lightweight decentralized information storage, and IOTA can properly complete this task."},"6":{"title":"(7) How to ensure that the certificate cannot be forged?","content":"We adopt asymmetric encryption and cryptographic hash to achieve immutable information and identity."},"7":{"title":"(8) What is the account recovery mechanism?","content":"The best case is all users remember their account password.
