        "title": "(4) Why certificates need blockchain?",
        "content": "1. Certificates are usually used at a large scale, and there are many cross-domain information transfers. If everyone uses the same agreement, they can communicate seamlessly. This is generally difficult to achieve due to trust factors, and the advent of blockchain has provided the possibility of unifying these standards. \n2. No one can easily paralyze the database, and the possibility of losing or tampering with identity data is extremely low. This is an incorruptible system with no single point of failure. \n3. After integrating the blockchain, the time cost of certificate verification can be greatly reduced."

        "title": "(6) Why utilizing IOTA instead of Ethereum?",
        "content": "1. Fast, no commission, we have set up a full node to quickly issue certificates. \n2. The design of Ethereum itself is expected to become a world computer, but the certificate does not need these additional computing functions. It only needs lightweight decentralized information storage, and IOTA can properly complete this task."
